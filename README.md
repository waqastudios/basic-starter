# basic-starter
A basic starter theme for the Inti Foundation WordPress parent theme

## Description
The Basic Starter theme is an example child theme for Inti Foundation. This child theme does not overwrite the parent theme's global styles or Foundation 6 styles. Instead, this theme is intended to allow you to quickly expand on the default styles by adding a few more and perhaps overwriting one or two manually.

To make use of Inti Foundation's features by to completely rebuilding Foundation 6 within your child theme, please refer to the other example theme, <a href="https://github.com/waqastudios/inti-kitchen-sink">Kitchen Sink</a>
