Stylesheet: Site Header

The site header wraps both the site-banner, the main navigation and
anything else that has been added to one of the hooks alongside them.
The site banner comes before or after the main navigation menu, it
normally includes a logo, or a full width hero image.

/**
 * Sticky Styles
 * ---------
 *
 *
 * Notes: Generally we call anything less than mlarge "mobile" as this incompasses
 * smaller tablets, tablets held in portrait and cell phones. This is where we switch
 * to the off-canvas menu by default.
 * 782px is the screen width that the Admin Bar in WordPress changes height from 32px to 46px
 *
 * This makes the existing top-bar sticky. If you have a sticky sidebar too, this will interfere,
 * you'll have to add more top margin to the sidebar when both are sticky. Users are given the option
 * to make sidebars sticky in Customize, in Page Options. You may want to hide that for your user.
 *
 * Foundation's Sticky feature makes the existing top-bar with the main navigation menu appear to stick
 * to the top of the page. It would generaly have the same design. If in your design you are displaying
 * the logo alongside the menu, you probably wrapped the sticky div around that too. If not, you might
 * want to add a logo into the top-bar when it is sticky - the mobile banner logo is already there - you
 * could show that.
 *
 * You can of course load a whole new top-bar once you scroll past the main one, and that can have its 
 * own style, but then you don't need the sticky functionality. 
 * 
 * i. Positioning for Admin users who see the Admin Bar
 * ii. Default sticky styles, including important width: 100%
